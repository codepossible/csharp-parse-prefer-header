# Parsing Prefer Header in C\#

## Introduction

This repository is a port of the Node version of parsing HTTP `Prefer` header to C#. The original code for Node written by Patrick Paskaris is available [here](https://github.com/ppaskaris/node-parse-prefer-header).

I ported this code to C\# for a project, I worked on and thought it might be useful for others using [RFC 7240](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240).
